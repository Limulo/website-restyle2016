[Arduino Leonardo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardLeonardo), on which the **BareConductive TouchBoard** is based, has 7 PWM channels: **3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11**, and **13**.

After [some experiments]({% post_url 2016-10-22-linuxday2016-penguin %}) where we wanted to make the board emit a sound and drive a servo at the same time when detecting a proximity via the MPR121, we have discovered that PWM pins **3, 5, 6** and **9** are not working as expected.

In other words, attaching a servo to those pins ends up in unpredictable results: sometimes the servo seems to work but no sound is emitted while in other tries neither the MP3 player and the servo work and the board is freezed (no _loop_ cycling).

Fortunately we were able to make everything work since PWM digital pins **10, 11** and **13** behaves normally.
