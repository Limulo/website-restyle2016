## Alphabet and Language

An _alphabet_ is a finite set of elements, called _symbols_ or _terminals_.
Let $$ \Sigma = \{ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k \} $$ be a k symbols alphabet. The _cardinality_ is $$ \|\Sigma\| \= \k $$
A _string_ or a _word_ is a sequence (ordered set with repetitions) of characters.

A _language_ is a set of strings belonging to a given alphabet
