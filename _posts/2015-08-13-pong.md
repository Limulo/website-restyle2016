Here's a little experiment. We tried to port Pong to Processing! Processing simulates the game mechanics of the game while sending OSC messages to PureData that is involved in real-time sound synthesis.

## How to make it works

First of all you have to:

* download and install [PureData Extended](http://puredata.info) version;
* download and install [Processing](https://processing.org);
* download and install **Andreas Schlegel**'s **oscP5** Processing library. You can use the _Add Library..._ utility directly from Processing or you can visit [this](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/) web page.

Then you have to:

* download and unzip our **Pong.zip** archive: you can download it from the [download](#pong-download-section) section;
* double-click on _Pong.pde_ file to open Processing;
* double-click on _Pong_sounds.pd_ file to open PureData;

Setup and Test the Pong sound application:

* Enable the Audio Output clicking on _Audio_ON_ button;
* Click on _keyb_TEST_ button to test the Application. Use your keyboard. Press any **number key** from ![1](/assets/images/pong/1.jpg) to ![9](/assets/images/pong/9.jpg) or ![spacebar](/assets/images/pong/spacebar.jpg). You can adjust the volume using the _Volume_ slider;
* If everything is ok, click on _OSC_ button to enable OSC messages receving;

Start the GAME !!!

* To start the game press _RUN_ button from the Processing IDE;

## Commands

* PLAYER 1 (Right) : **ARROW** keys, ![UP](/assets/images/pong/UP.jpg){: float="left;"} and ![DOWN](/assets/images/pong/DOWN.jpg){: display="inline;"};
* PLAYER 2 (Left)  : ![W](/assets/images/pong/W.jpg){: display="inline;"} and ![S](/assets/images/pong/S.jpg){: display="inline;"} keys;


Enjoy!

## Devolopment notes

This game needs a lot of improvements! For example:

* The game needs an intro screen where the player can select the difficulty level;
* What do you think about the gameplay? How about collision detection mechanisms?
* Does it sounds good to you? Maybe it's better to change Square Wave to a Sawtooth Wave, or something like that :)
* And what if I want yo play alone against the PC? We have to implement a simple Artificial Intelligence algorithm for the opponent;
* Now it looks unnatural, what about adding a graphical effect to resemble playing it throug a CRT or Phosphor monitor? Maybe using GPU acceleration and one specific shader to do the job...
* What about an HTML5 version?
* Do you see more? try yourself and let us know!
