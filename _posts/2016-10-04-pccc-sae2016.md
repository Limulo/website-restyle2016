We designed and developed an introductory Physical Computing class using _Arduino_ and _RaspberryPi_. We presented it this Autumn at **SAE Institute**. 

The topic of the course is the introduction (either theoretical either practical) of the basic programming tools, as well as of the basis of Electronics. The goal of the course is to invent and develope prototypes of future useful tools.

Some of the subjects we dealt with are: sensors, interfaces, serial and I2C communication protocols, libraries, Gnu/Linux OS, command line and shell scripting, Python.
