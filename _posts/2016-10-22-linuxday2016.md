The _Linux Day_ is an annual event dedicated to Gnu/Linux, during which in many italian cities some local groups organise meetings, workshops and talks to support the Gnu/Linux OS and the Free Software philosophy.
This year **limulo.net** took part to the events organised in Milan ([Linux Day 2016](http://www.linuxdaymilano.org/)), contributing with 5 interactive installations.

We let people interact with: _Arduino_, _RaspberryPi_, computer vision with _OpenCV_, generative music and live coding with _SuperCollider_ and _SonicPi_, visuals with _Processing_, procedural audio with _PureData_.

Here's a [link](https://limulo.github.io/linuxday2016/) to the workshop website where you can find more information about other interactive station we have created for the **Linux Day Milan 2016**. From this same link you can reach our **GitHub** repository where you can find all interactive station source code.
