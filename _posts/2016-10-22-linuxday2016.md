**limulo.net** realizza 5 installazioni interattive in occasione del , evento dedicato al software libero e Open Source.

The _Linux Day_ is an annual event dedicated to Gnu/Linux, during which in many italian cities some local groups organise meetings, workshops and talks to support the Gnu/Linux OS and the Free Software philosophy.
This year **limulo.net** took part to the events organised in Milan ([Linux Day 2016](http://www.linuxdaymilano.org/)), contributing with 5 interactive installations.

We let people interact with: _Arduino_, _RaspberryPi_, computer vision with _OpenCV_, generative music and live coding with _SuperCollider_ and _SonicPi_, visuals with _Processing_, procedural audio with _PureData_.
