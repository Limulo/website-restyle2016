We designed and developed some introductory lessons about videogames development and sounddesign for videogames. We teached them in at **SAE Institute** Milan.

The lessons give an historical overview of the evolution of sound in video games; we look also at the various professional figures involved in videogame development, we analyze the tools used in the various phases (game engines, sound, physics, AI middleware and other tools).

Finally, we examine in depth sound in videogame, both as a data driven model and as a procedural paradigm.
