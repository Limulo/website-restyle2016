We designed and developed two introductory lessons about videogames development and sound. We teached them in May 2017 at **SAE Institute** Milan.

The lessons give an historical overview of the evolution of sound in video games; we look also at the various professional figures involved in videogame development, we analyze the tools used in the various phases (game engines, other tools and middleware).

Finally, we examine in depth sound in videogame, both as a data driven model and as a procedural paradigm.

We give several practical examples including _AdLib Visual Composer_ and _Instrument Creator_, _Fasttracker II_, _Unity_, _fmod_ _PureData_ patches.
