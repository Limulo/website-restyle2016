Here's a lesson **limulo.net** created to introduce _Physical Computing_.
The lesson is in the form of a workshop with students strongly invited to interact and explore the technologies presented.
There are 4 interactive stations, each of them providing a food for thought about art, free software, open source, computer vision and procedural graphics, sound synthesis and generative music, videogames and programming languages.

Here the [link](https://limulo.github.io/ws-ied2016/) to the workshop website!
