Time for new interesting sounds!

For this project I have been responsible for sound design. My client needed his animation work to be enriched by sound. The sound should have been interesting and descriptive but, at the same time, not overpowering.

I've recorded and synthetized new sounds, I've synchronized and mixed them and eventually obtained the final sound track which you can listen to here.

Enjoy:
