Welcome in this repo!

This is hte place where we are saving our **WIP** files for [limulo.net](http://www.limulo.net) website restyle.

For this particular restyle we are using a Jekyll theme called [**Hyde**](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) made by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo).

## How to create a page
If you want the page to appears inside the sidebar you have to give that page a **front matter** like the one shown below

  ---
  layout: page
  title: myAwsomwTitle
  ---

where you explicitly define the title for the page.

If you don't want your page to appear in the sidebar, simply put the title of the page outside the **front matter**:

  ---
  layout: page
  ---
  # myAwsomwTitle

## How to create a post

to create a post put relevant information inside the **front matter** such as:

* title
* date
* excerpt
* categories

A post cannot avoid having at least one **category** since categories provides the site navigation logic. If you want your post to have more than one category, simply put all of them inside square brackets, comma separeted. For example:

  category: [installation, issue]

A post can also have a shortcut image that will be shown at the bottom of the **homepage**.

  shortcut: shortcut-jags.png

If you don't specified a dedicated image for the post, the post will be given a default image accoring to its belonging to a particular category.

In this case you will not see the post listed in the homepage but you can access the post browsing its category page.
