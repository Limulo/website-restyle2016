If we want to smooth unwanted noises or annoying fluctuations of an electric signal we read from an analog sensor we have to create a filter.

There are different ways we can achieve that, some of them are software solutions, other relays on hardware components.

## software
* Tom Igoe solution: [smoothing](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Smoothing)
* smoothing by [farnell]() + Miller filters
* un altro modo potrebbe essere quello di trascurare i bit meno significativi

## hardware
We have to realize a simple circuit, the so called RC filter.

The theory tells us that if we accurately calibreate the value of **R** and **C**, we can precisely define $$ f_{c} $$, the **cut frequency** as:

$$
f_{c} = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C}
$$

To test it we can use a **photoresistor**.

In case we want to send information about 2 values via serial, we need a way for the receiving program to discriminate between the ones coming from the first and the second.

Taking inspiration from the MIDI protocol, where the most significant bit of a byte is used to differentiate between _status_ and _data_ byte, here we do the same using **0** as the most significant bit for the byte coming from the first sensor and **1** for the second.
