Welcome to our **writings** page: here you'll find links to some book or papers we've written.

## Diario in Codice

"_Diario in Codice_" is a book about programming basics we are writing and hopefully we'll be able to publish. 
It has been supported by the community via a _crowdfunding campaign_ and it will be published with a _selfpublishing platform_.

The book is written in italian and it concerns the basis of programming and coding usign Arduino as a practical mean to apply the theory.

[Here](https://ariutti.github.io/diario-in-codice/)'s the official webpage of the book where you can obtain more information.
